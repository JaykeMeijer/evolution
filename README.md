# Evolution

Evolution is an evolution simulation.

# TODO

Evolution:
- Implement brain and non-random moves
- Add food, moving towards food (gives energy)
- Add fighting / eating eachother: bigger is better, fighting genome
- Add speed as genetic parameter

Simulation:
- Optimize vincinity detection for reproduction (look at quad trees, r trees)
- Pause/Play simulation
- Click on beast for stats

# Would be cool

- Add items to environment - obstacles, dangers
- Add environment factors that suite certain beasts, eg forest limits size
- Add aging, disease
